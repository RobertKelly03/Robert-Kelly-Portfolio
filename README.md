# Robert-Kelly-Portfolio
Robert Kelly's Portfolio Web-Page 

This is my (Robert Kelly) first ever website and pretty much my first time attempting to create something with code, I am still unsure how to complete some of the tasks and I deffinately need to work on some of the skills provided by the course. This website showcases the basics of my CSS and HTML abilites. 

You will find a Navigation bar, a title, a profile image, an About Me section, A my works section with different Cards for future projects, and a contact me section that I spent way too much time working on. Overall I deffinately struggled with this project but I plan to improve it the more I progress through the bootcamp.

*I have been having issues with my live website looking the same as my website i open from VS Code.
